# Contributing to Flare

Flare handles private keys and leveraged trading. A small patch can have financial consequences, so correctness and explicit failure behavior take priority over convenience.

## Development principles

1. Keep protocol and chain code out of ViewModels and composables.
2. Use Kaptos for every Aptos payload, simulation, signature, submission, balance query, and transaction wait.
3. Keep `:decibel` Compose-free and multiplatform.
4. Accept transaction prices, quantities, and collateral amounts as decimal strings. Do not introduce `Double` into transaction construction.
5. Simulate before authorization, journal the signed hash before submission, and preserve uncertain outcomes for reconciliation.
6. Never log secrets, signatures, complete transaction payloads, session tokens, or private account responses.
7. Preserve Flare's pinned dependency baseline. When integration fails because Kaptos lacks an API, update Kaptos rather than lowering Flare's Compose, Kotlin, Android, or Vico versions.

## Local setup

Follow the prerequisites and setup steps in [README.md](README.md).

### Developing with Local Kaptos Builds

For unpublished dependency work, publish FastKrypto and then Kaptos to Maven Local:

```sh
# In the FastKrypto repository
rustup run 1.92 ./gradlew -PenableSigning=false publishToMavenLocal

# In the Kaptos repository
./gradlew -PenableSigning=false publishToMavenLocal
```

Then build Flare with local dependency resolution enabled:

```sh
FLARE_MAVEN_LOCAL=true ./gradlew :decibel:jvmTest
```

Do not commit absolute paths or use checkout paths as Gradle dependencies.

## Change workflow

- Add focused tests for protocol JSON, fixed-point math, BCS payloads, authentication policy, or UI-state transitions as appropriate.
- Run Android, iOS compilation, and Decibel tests before opening a pull request. Changes spanning the proxy contract must also pass the separate `decibel-worker` repository's checks.
- Explain any security-boundary change in the pull request and update [THREAT_MODEL.md](THREAT_MODEL.md) when an assumption changes.
- Keep unrelated formatting and generated changes out of the patch.

Minimum local gate:

```sh
./gradlew :decibel:jvmTest :shared:testAndroidHostTest :androidApp:assembleDebug
./gradlew :shared:compileKotlinIosSimulatorArm64
```

## Protocol changes

Treat the [Decibel full documentation](https://docs.decibel.trade/llms-full.txt) and published Move entry functions as the source of truth. Capture new response shapes as JSON fixtures and new transaction calls as golden ABI/BCS tests. Large Aptos integers and IDs must remain strings or explicit integer wrappers.

## Security reports

Do not open public issues for vulnerabilities involving key material, authorization, Worker credentials, sponsorship, replay, or transaction integrity. Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
